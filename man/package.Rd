This function's (and package's) sole purpose is to provide
a synonym for R's technically-correct-but-confusing \code{library}
function.
The official story from \href{http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-the-difference-between-package-and-library_003f}{R FAQ 7.29}: "\ldots \code{library()} is employed to load a package from libraries containing packages."}

\examples{
package("MASS")
## this is not guaranteed to produce library-vs-package snark,
## but it probably will.
if (require("fortunes")) fortune("library")
}
